Abstract: Generative Neural Radiance Field (GNeRF) models, which extract implicit 3D representations from 2D images, 
have recently been shown to produce realistic images representing rigid/semi-rigid objects, 
such as human faces or cars. However, they usually struggle to generate high-quality images representing 
non-rigid objects, such as the human body, which is of a great interest for many computer graphics applications. 
This paper proposes a 3D-aware Semantic-Guided Generative Model (3D-SGAN) for human image synthesis, 
which combines a GNeRF with a texture generator. The former learns an implicit 
3D representation of the human body and outputs a set of 2D semantic segmentation masks. The latter transforms 
these semantic masks into a real image, adding a realistic texture to the human appearance. 
Without requiring additional 3D information, our model can learn 3D human representations 
with a photo-realistic, controllable generation. Our experiments on the DeepFashion dataset show that 
3D-SGAN significantly outperforms the most recent baselines.
